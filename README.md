# DogBreed_Classification

In this timely competition, kaggle provided a strictly canine subset of ImageNet in order to classify a dog's breed based on several photos. I say this is a timely project because I just adopted a dog from our local rescue and I would like to have a degree of certainty of what type of dog breed she is. The data is divided into training and test set. We have over 10,000 images of training of data and 120 possible breeds. I believe I sucessfully determined the breed of my new dog, Dixie, from her three images.
